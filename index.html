    <h1>Vegetable Stir-Fry</h1>
    <p>The way we'll <i>cook vegetables is called a stir-fry</i>. This is a way of cooking that comes from China . We're going to put our vegetables in a skillet with very high heat and cook it really quickly and add a flavorful sauce toward the end. You can cook pretty much
         any <u>vegetable from the garden</u> this way.I like Vegetable stir fry because is one of those low-effort meals we<span style="color:rgb(253, 117, 6);font-weight:bold"> love around here</span>. It's a snap to make, packs a ton of veggies into one dish, and scratches the salty-crunching craving we often get . Our simple stir fry sauce and a pot of perfectly cooked white or brown rice are a simple and delicious.</p>

     Taste: The taste of a vegetable stir-fry should be a harmonious balance of flavors and textures. Each bite should offer a variety of vegetables bursting with freshness and natural sweetness, complemented by the umami-rich sauce.

</article>

<div class="row">
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol class="instruction">
  <li><strong>Prep Work:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Fill a large pot with water, add a generous pinch of salt, and bring it to a boil.</li>
      <li>While waiting for the water to boil, dice the pancetta or guanciale, grate the cheeses, and mince the garlic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Cook Spaghetti:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
      <li>Reserve about a cup of pasta water before draining the spaghetti.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Prepare Sauce:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses until well combined. Set aside.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Cook Pancetta:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until it turns crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add minced garlic to the skillet and cook for another minute, stirring constantly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Combine Everything:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and garlic.</li>
      <li>Toss the spaghetti with the pancetta and garlic until well coated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Add Sauce:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the spaghetti.</li>
      <li>Working quickly, toss the spaghetti continuously to coat it evenly with the sauce. The residual heat will cook the eggs gently, creating a creamy sauce.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Adjust Consistency:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Divide the Spaghetti Carbonara among plates or bowls.</li>
      <li>Garnish with freshly ground black pepper and chopped Italian parsley.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately and enjoy the creamy, comforting flavors of this classic Italian dish!</li>
    </ul>
